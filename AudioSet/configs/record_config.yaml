# Device selection for the experiment
#The ALSA hardware number (hw:X,Y) is the identifier used by ALSA to access the physical devices.
#Sounddevice device indices (like 0, 1, etc.) are assigned by sounddevice based on the devices it finds. These indices don't directly correlate with ALSA's hw:X,Y numbers.
